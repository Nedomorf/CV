## <b>Experience and Solved Problems:</b>
My projects have solved a variety of problems. For example, I’ve created a mobile and web application that allows users to track their spending, a mobile and web application that helps people to take a care of theirs health,  a mobile application that helps businesses manage their inventory, a web application that allows users to learn a new language and a desktop application for time tracking.
### **Healthcare [BeWell](https://bewell.uk) project:**

Application that allows users to take control of their medicines, drug stores and own doctor recommendations. Helps easier buy and book medicines depending on medicine recipes. These are some of the main features of the app.
<br/>
The first feature of the app is the medicine management system. Users can input the details of their medications, such as the name, dosage, and frequency, and set reminders for taking them. This would ensure that they never miss a dose and remain committed to their medication schedule.
<br/>
The app also has a drug store locator feature that allows users to find nearby pharmacies based on their location. They can view information about each pharmacy, such as opening hours, contact details, and services offered. Furthermore, users can compare prices of different medications at various pharmacies and choose the one that offers the best value for money.<br/>
Another feature of the app is the ability to store and manage doctor recommendations. Users can upload and keep track of all medical records, including test results, prescriptions, and referrals. Additionally, they can set reminders for upcoming doctor appointments and receive notifications when it's time to schedule another appointment.
<br/>
Finally, the app has a chatbot feature that provides users with quick and easy access to medical advice. The chatbot is trained to answer basic medical questions and provide users with relevant information about common health issues.
<br/>
> Overall, the app is a comprehensive solution for people looking to take control of their healthcare needs. With features such as medicine management, drug store locators, doctor recommendation management, and chatbots, users can stay on top of their health and make informed decisions about their well-being.

<br/>

### **Finance [Finmatex](https://finmatex.com) project:**

Application that allows users to track their incomes and spending, control budget and bills.
<br/>
At first, the application allows users to sign up and create a profile. They would be able to enter their income and other financial information or put it from their bank accounts, which would be used to calculate their budget.
<br/>
Users are able to track their income by entering their paychecks, additional income, and any other forms of monetary gain into the app.
The app allows users to easily categorize their expenses and track them over time. For example, they could input bills, groceries, entertainment expenses, etc.
<br/>
Based on the user’s income and expenses, the app can generate a budget for the month or week. Users could also set customized budgets for each category of spending, such as limiting their entertainment expenses.
There are feature to send users reminders to pay their bills as per the due date. Users can also view their bill payment history and get insights on upcoming bills.
<br/>
The app also has a savings feature that would help users save money by setting goals and tracking progress towards those goals.
<br/>
Also it provides reports on the user's financial health, spending history, trends, and patterns. This information would help users make informed decisions about their spending habits.
<br/>
> Overall, this application allows users to easily keep track of their finances, set goals, and manage their budgets and bills in one convenient location.

<br/>

### **Delivery project:**

Application that helps a company to track packages and delivery stations.
<br/>
The application is designed to allow the company to input information about each package, such as its destination, weight, value, and expected delivery date or just scan a package barcode. As the package travels through the shipping process, the application can update its status in real time, so that the company can always know exactly where it is.
<br/>
In addition to tracking individual packages, the application also provides insights into the performance of each delivery station. By analyzing data on things like delivery times, shipping costs, and customer satisfaction ratings, the company could identify areas where it needs to make improvements.
<br/>
The application is really user-friendly, because it has a simple and intuitive interface. The company's employees’ able to access the information they need with just a few clicks, and managers are able to generate reports to help them make informed decisions.
<br/>
> Overall, this application is a valuable tool for any company that needs to keep track of packages and delivery stations. It helps to streamline the shipping process, improve customer satisfaction, and drive profitability over the long term.
